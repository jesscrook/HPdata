# HPdata
character relational data from the Harry Potter corpora

This is data that has been explanded on from https://github.com/MathRyan/PotterData. It includes more characters, now including 111 characters instead of the original 50. Each pair of characters is scored and given a value from -5 to 5. Note that the pairings are not symettric (i.e. Kreacher really hates Voldemort but Voldemort has no feelings towards Kreacher). The character field also contains the affiliations and morality of each character, which are subjective, but should portray the characters strongest ties throughout the books. The scale, also produced by Ryan, is below:

+/-1 - Acquaintances / Rivals

+/-2 - Friends / Enemies

+/-3 - Allies / Violent Hatred

+/-4 - Family / Sworn Enemy

+/-5 - Father-Son / Close Betrayal
